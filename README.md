This repository contains two analysis files based on the **Vrinda Store 2022** dataset. The project includes both **Power BI** and **Python** analyses.

## Power BI Analysis
- **Dashboard** that showcases:
  - Total Sales
  - Total Sales by Channel
  - Total Sales by Category
  - Total Sales by Size
  - Total Sales by Age Group
  - Total Sales by State (Map)
  - Month slicer for dynamic reporting

## Python Analysis
The Python analysis includes several key metrics and visualizations using libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The steps include:
- Data import, cleaning, and transformation.
- **MoM Growth Calculation**: Month-on-Month growth of sales.
- **Total Sales Analysis**: By Year, Month, Category, State, Age Group, etc.
- **Sales Growth Over Time**: Analyzing the sales trend and performance.
- **Sales Funnel Chart**: Tracking customer conversion at various stages.
- **Distribution of Sales**: Sales distribution across different states, categories, etc.
- **Top Customers**: Analysis of top customers by purchase amount.

## Setup
